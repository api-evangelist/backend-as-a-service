<p>Last week we significantly revamped our docs and docs search. Which do you prefer, old or new?As part of that switch, we migrated from away from Read The Docs to hosting them ourselves.Read The Docs is great but our requirements changed and we needed to move, and we think in the switch we’ve got a few immediate wins:
 Unscientifically, our search function is much better, using elasticsearch rather than in-page JavaScript search
 The look-and-feel of the docs is much more consistent with the rest of our web site
 We made a couple of little macros to handle things like API method signatures - yes, Sphinx has these, but they’re tailored towards Python, not JavaScript, and we think our version is much better for our needs.When we first launched our Trigger.</p>
