{% include JB/setup %}<p>Is it us, or does it kind of feel like the tools we’ve been working with to create apps in the last few years haven’t really changed all that much?Sure there are open source or independent IDEs out there if you really want to change how you operate as an app developer, but the bread and butter of development is choosing either XCode or Eclipse and creating apps in those environments.Now, we’ve done articles before on the supposed benefits or lack of, of both of these IDEs, but overall, they are both kind of just industry standard.That’s changed recently though.Google’s I/O conference went down recently, and whilst a lot of interesting stuff was announced (like we’re going to get a Nexus version of the Galaxy SIV, hold your techgasms if you can people), the most interesting thing for app developers was the reveal of Google Android Studio.</p>
