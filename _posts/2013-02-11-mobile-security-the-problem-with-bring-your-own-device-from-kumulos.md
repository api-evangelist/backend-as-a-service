{% include JB/setup %}<p>So the BlackBerry 10 is now out in the wild and has been seeing respectable but not astonishing sales, (despite the company’s best efforts to make it seem otherwise).Despite being a solid phone, the new device has many hurdles to jump before it can see sales figures that will change BlackBerry’s recent downward spiral.One of the major hurdles is the BYOD or Bring Your Own Device mobile culture that has strongly permeated corporate culture in recent years.In fact it’s one of the often cited reasons for the initial fall of popularity in the BlackBerry, as they made fantastic work phones from the tech department’s point of view, but they weren’t the sexy objects of tech lust like the iPhone or the high tier Androids.Whereas it used to be that companies gave their employees a work phone that was locked down with various security measures and the employee would have to have a separate personal phone, now due the multitasking ability and expense of smartphones, companies are opting to let employees bring their own phones, which is causing all kinds of security woes.On Android especially, security is lagging behind the current threats, leaving the potential for infected devices wide open and ready to be exploited by cybercriminals looking for ways into a company’s private data.“Right now the most widespread threats are SMS trojans, advertising modules and exploits designed to gain root access to the smartphone.However, at the start of 2012 we also saw the emergence of the first mobile botnet, a clear indication that cybercriminals are paying more attention to mobile devices,” said David Emm, a security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, “Then there is the risk of data loss from lost or stolen devices that contain sensitive business information or from conducting confidential transactions on insecure networks, for example public Wi-Fi hotspots.”
 So without even realising it is happening, an employee doing some work at a cafe after hours on their smartphone could in fact be handing a cybercriminal all the data they need for repenetrating the company network or indeed, just handing off corporate secrets that could be sold on to the highest bidder.In this world of high end corporate espionage where getting your rival’s secrets could mean the difference between being kicked out of the competitive running and managing to keep your edge and billions of dollars lost or gained, it’s little surprise that companies are being targeted through their weakest point, the smartphones.</p>
