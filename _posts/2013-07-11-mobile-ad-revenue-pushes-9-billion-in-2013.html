<p>IAB has recently published a report on Global Advertising Revenue and how it has increased 83% from 2012 to 2013.The majority of this is due to search and display adverts which has been helping to push it towards $9 Billion in revenue during 2012 according to figures by the IAB and IHS.This means that by 2013 we should expect to see more of a consumer growth in this area.As in previous years the rate of growth has been exponential, 83% seems phenomenal until you realise the pace at which technology moves.The trend we have seen towards a mobile oriented shift means that the market is only going to keep growing at an exponential rate.</p>
