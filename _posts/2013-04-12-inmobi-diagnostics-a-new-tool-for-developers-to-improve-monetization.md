title: InMobi Diagnostics – A new tool for developers to improve monetization
---
{% include JB/setup %}<p>  At InMobi we are constantly working on making it easy for our customers/partners to integrate faster and make life easier.  We are very excited to share this with all of you (and as always look forward to your feedback and suggestions).  Sending more information as part of an ad request improves monetization.  As sending more information is not always easy, we have built a new tool, InMobi Diagnostics, to help you.  With Diagnostics you can: 
 Integrate faster
 
 Developers often receive ‘no fill’ messages from ad serving systems due to faulty ad requests.  Upon setup, Diagnostics provides actionable next steps to the developer based on what went wrong with integration.  This quickly enables the developer to rectify integration issues in a single sitting.  Improving Monetization
 Developers, who do not receive expected eCPMs for some of their inventory segments, typically optimize for what just works or divert traffic to other ad networks.  In essence, they are not well equipped with tools to help themselves and solve problems related to monetization.  Diagnostics highlights information that is missing from ad requests and indicates how to send them as well.<br />
