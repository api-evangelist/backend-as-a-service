<p>The VMworld 2014 site boldly announced that the mobile-cloud era has arrived, and we at Kinvey agree.We are seeing mobile as the key driver for enterprise cloud adoption.It makes sense – providing infrastructure, a platform, and development tools as a managed service allows organizations to focus on building great apps and shields them from the cost and time sinks of creating and managing a platform that needs to be updated on a regular basis to keep pace.Which is why we’re extremely excited to not only collaborate with VMware but also have them as a customer.VMware has migrated the company’s My VMware customer support app to Kinvey on vCloud Air.</p>
