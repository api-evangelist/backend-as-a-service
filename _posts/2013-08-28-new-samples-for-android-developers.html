<p>Many of you have asked for more sample projects and tutorials for our Android SDK.We’ve heard you, and today we’re excited to share three new sample apps for Parse and Android:
 MealSpotting: This app lets users take a photo of a meal they’re eating, give it a title and a rating, and upload it to Parse.The tutorial covers how to save an image to Parse in a ParseFile
 and use it later in UI elements like the ParseImageView
 or ParseQueryAdapter.It features examples of custom subclasses of ParseObject
 and ParseQueryAdapter
, including a custom layout for a ParseQueryAdapter
 One-to-Many Relationships: We’ve added an Android version of our One-to-Many Relationships tutorial, which uses a simple blogging app example to demonstrate creating and querying one-to-many relationships.Integrating Facebook: For those of you writing social apps, we’ve released a Facebook tutorial that covers logging users in through Facebook and making requests to Facebook’s API.</p>
