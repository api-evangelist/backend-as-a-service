{% include JB/setup %}<p>APIs are everywhere.The number of public APIs available on ProgrammableWeb are growing at a dizzying pace, with current count being at 7,207.The number of API service providers and tools supporting the new demand for simple, web APIs that mobile and web developers can use has seen the same pace of growth.I&rsquo;m getting requests for API 101 materials across all business sectors from healthcare to the federal government.The pace of API consumption is growing as well, and up until recently, we only communicate in single words using APIs--we checkin, post, share, get, friend, like.&nbsp;Now that we have learned the basic words, we need a way to form more meaningful&nbsp;phrases and sentences to communicate using APIs.In the past month I&rsquo;ve explored a couple different areas where I&rsquo;m seeing APIs evolve from single uses into more aggregate, flowing forms of communication using APIs:

Backend as a Service(BaaS) - Building in the resources developers need most when building mobile or web apps into a single stack, bringing together the back-end and middleware to make developers more successful.API Automation - Providing iconographic tools for any users, even non-developers to string together actions between multiple APIs.Bundling them into reusable recipes, and automating our personal and business lives in the cloud.Mobile Builder Platforms - Platforms that provide hosted tools for developers and non-developers to rapidly build cross-platform mobile applications using content from RSS and APIs.</p>
