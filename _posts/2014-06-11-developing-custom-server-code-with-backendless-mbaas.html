<p>As an mBaaS platform we frequently say “no server-side coding is required”.This is true for a lot of apps, however, at times it is necessary to shift some application logic to the server-side.The logic may need to alter or extend the default implementation of the core services.Adding custom business logic is not only easy with Backendless, but the process is really cool and exciting.The combination of a code generator with the local debugging option makes it a killer feature.</p>
