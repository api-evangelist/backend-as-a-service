OPENi isn’t all about APIs, in fact the OPENi Platform is composed of four major components, only one of which is the API framework.The three others are 1) the Cloudlet Storage framework which is responsible for storing users’ data, 2) the Security Framework which handles authentication, authorisation, and much more, and 3) the mobile client libraries which provide generic building blocks that allow the development of applications that utilise OPENi services.As outlined in previous blogs the OPENi API framework will be capable of interoperating with a variety of cloud-based services.It will abstract the integration challenges to a single open standard without losing any service features.It is our belief that it will promote innovation by offering application developers an advanced framework that enables them to design and build complex applications involving the combinations of independent cloud-based services.</p>
