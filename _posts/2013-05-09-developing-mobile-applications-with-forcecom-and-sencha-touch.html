<p>In Part 1 and Part 2 of our series on Developing Mobile Applications with Force.com and Sencha Touch, we built out a simple mobile application hosted in a Salesforce.com Visualforce page to display a list of Leads, and allowing add, edit and delete capability using an Apex controller.In this third part of the series, we want to highlight the enterprise data capability of Sencha Touch, so we’ll focus on how the framework allows us to work with large datasets by adding paging and search capability to the PocketCRM application.Along the way, we’ll show you how well the Sencha data proxy works in conjunction with querying data in Apex using SOQL and its OFFSET paging feature, and we’ll leverage the concept of Sencha plugins for component reusability and extensibility.</p>
