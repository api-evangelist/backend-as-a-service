{% include JB/setup %}<p>Backend as a Service (BaaS), sometimes called Mobile Backend is a Service (MBaaS) is a growing trend I&rsquo;m monitoring at API Evangelist.I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 providers in the space, with two newly added open-source BaaS platforms.Beyond the research, stories and analysis on BaaS, I just added a BaaS panel at the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference in New York City, February 21st and 22nd.The panel will include six of the leading BaaS platforms:

Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine
James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase
Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii
Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey
Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse
Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;


API play a critical role in BaaS platforms by providing interfaces for the common services emerging in the BaaS space, like object storage, user management and location, to name a few, but also bring in other 3rd party services like Twitter and Facebook.I will be moderating this new BaaS panel at APIStrat.</p>
