<p>Transforming a business to an API-centric architecture is a major undertaking, but it’s one that yields many benefits, most notably the ability to grow the business by extending processes to partners.In his keynote presentation at WSO2Con US 2013, Sastry Malladi, chief architect for StubHub, explained how the company has implemented an API-centric architecture to capitalize on this opportunity.According to Malladi, adopting an API-centric architecture was driven by two factors.First, the company wants to expand from an online marketplace for tickets to become an end-to-destination for fans, including sharing their event experiences and getting information about things to do in event locales.Second, StubHub, which currently has a presence in three countries, plans to expand worldwide.</p>
