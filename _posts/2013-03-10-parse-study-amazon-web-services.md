The San Francisco-based startup delivers a full stack of mobile services so that developers can focus on developing applications and leave the infrastructure to Parse.  Launched in 2012, this fast-growing start-up provides server management for about 60,000 Android, iOS, and Windows mobile applications, which run on more than 200 million mobile devices.  Parse operates a number of high-throughput, I/O intensive MongoDB clusters and needed to improve scalability and speed.  Parse handles user account management, data storage and disk caching for its customers and usage can fluctuate on a daily basis.  Charity Majors, Site Reliability Engineer says, “If an application developed on Parse is featured on iTunes, traffic can triple or quadruple in a matter of hours.  Our platform needs to be consistent and fast.  If Parse has operational issues, then more than 50,000 mobile applications have operational issues.  We don’t have the luxury of taking the platform down for 15 minutes to fix something.  ”
