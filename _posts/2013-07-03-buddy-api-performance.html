<p>At buddy the basic atomic unit of performance is how fast our API’s execute end to end.We track the total time of the API from when the packets enter our data centers to when they exit.We can’t ensure performance all the way to the client (phone app, web app, different countries) but we can control the cloud segment.Our stated performance bar for every Buddy API is to execute in totality in under 1000ms second.That 1000ms second includes the web service, caching, logging, fetching, and all of the other items we do when a API is called.</p>
