<p>When writing modern mobile apps, developers have to consider the reality that end users may not always have network access.This can be due to a transient network issue, or it could be a mobile app thatâ€™s often used in remote areas with little connectivity.To make it easier to write these kinds of apps, the Azure Mobile Services SDK offers a preview feature for syncing your backend data with a local database on the device.The feature is available on both the JavaScript and.NET backends, and supports multiple clients: Windows Store, Windows Phone, iOS, Xamarin iOS, and Xamarin Android.</p>
