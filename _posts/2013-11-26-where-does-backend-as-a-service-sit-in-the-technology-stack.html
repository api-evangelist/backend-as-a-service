<p>Red Hat’s Director of OpenShift Strategy, Krishnan Subramanian, recently interviewed our CEO, Sravish Sridhar and senior cloud strategy marketing and evangelism manager at Red Hat, Gordon Haff.They discussed how Backend as a Service and Platform as a Service are coming together disrupt mobile development in the enterprise.Below is an excerpt from the interview and you can watch the full interview here.Krishnan Subramanian: There are misconceptions in the industry about where exactly MBaaS sits in the different layers of the technology stack.  In fact, I read an article recently on GigaOM Pro where the author talked about MBaaS sitting on top of PaaS, which sits on top of IaaS.</p>
