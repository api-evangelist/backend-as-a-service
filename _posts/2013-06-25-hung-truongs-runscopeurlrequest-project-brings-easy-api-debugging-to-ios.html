<p>Its near impossible to build an iOS app without using a web service API to send data back and forth between the app and your (or someone elses) servers.We hear from many of our customers that when trouble arises with these integrations debugging is cumbersome and slow.Hung Truong built Runscope-iOS to make solving those types of problems with Runscope even easier.Hung is an Ann Arbor-based developer working for a creative/design/engineering firm called  NewFoundry.He spends most of his free time working on iOS apps and has a particular fondness for APIs.</p>
