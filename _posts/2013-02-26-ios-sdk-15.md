{% include JB/setup %}<p>QBChatDelegate: Now you dont need to use – (void)chatRoomDidCreate:(QBChatRoom*)room.In all cases (create or join room) chatRoomDidEnter: method will be called
 QBChat: Added new method for room creation: – (void)createOrJoinRoomWithName:(NSString *)name membersOnly:(BOOL)isMembersOnly persistent:(BOOL)isPersistent.Old methods marked as deprecated.New SDK need to connect some additional frameworks – please follow How to: add SDK to Xcode and connect to the cloud 
 Good luck with your code!</p>
