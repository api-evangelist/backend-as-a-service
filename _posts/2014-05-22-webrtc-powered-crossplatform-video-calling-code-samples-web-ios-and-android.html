<p>Video calling is now becoming truly cross-platform thanks to emerging WebRTC technology.QuickBlox has brought easy “drag’n’drop” video calling to iOS in early 2013 and to Android later same year.iOS and Android video calling libraries in QuickBlox were made compatible with each other allowing users of two most popular mobile platforms to call each other as seen in Skype, Facetime etc.In addition to Chat, Push Notifications and other APIs of QuickBlox it allowed thousands of our users to seamlessly connect their user base and enable multi-channel communication in their mobile apps.Integrating video calls into web or desktop apps however has always been challenging.</p>
