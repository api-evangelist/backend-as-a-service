---
{% include JB/setup %}<p>  Vision Mobile published a new report about developer tools.  The report is based on an online survey of over 3,400 developers.  The survey respondents were balanced across Europe (39%), Asia (27%) and North America (24%).  As mobile apps become more sophisticated the need for backend features like managing users, introducing social features, or synchronizing cloud data increases.   In the following post you read the key insights about the backend as a service market according to this report.  The main BaaS selection criteria for developers are availability across platforms and the flexibility of the service.  E.  g.  the ability to implement custom business logic seems to be a very important aspect.   Further more the richness of the feature set is considered important too.<br />
