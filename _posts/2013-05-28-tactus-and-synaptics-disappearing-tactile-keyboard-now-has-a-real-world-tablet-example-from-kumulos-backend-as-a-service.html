<p>When the first iPhone arrived on the scene, it wasn’t the first all touch screen phone (that honour, so far as anyone can tell, goes to the LG Prada), but, as we know, it was the biggest by far.At the time of the iPhone’s release it was a touch screen phone in a sea of physical keyboards.Blackberry ruled the world with full qwerty and most people couldn’t see the advantage of a phone that had only one button.How the hell were you meant to type with it?Well, things have obviously changed somewhat since then, obviously.</p>
