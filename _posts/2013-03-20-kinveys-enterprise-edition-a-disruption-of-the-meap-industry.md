{% include JB/setup %}<p>We are thrilled to introduce the Kinvey Enterprise Edition platform. Just as Kinvey allows individual and agency developers to rapidly prototype, publish and manage consumer apps, we are now bringing that same power to enterprise developers that are responsible for equipping an increasingly mobile workforce with powerful business apps. The new Kinvey platform allows enterprise developers to build and maintain secure mobile apps that can “mobilize” data from virtually any data source. Right out of the gate, Kinvey’s Enterprise Edition platform is being used by global enterprises for mobile apps that authenticate via LDAP and Active Directory, and connect to their Salesforce CRM™ and Oracle® databases.You can find out everything you need to know about the Enterprise Edition platform in our press release.</p>
