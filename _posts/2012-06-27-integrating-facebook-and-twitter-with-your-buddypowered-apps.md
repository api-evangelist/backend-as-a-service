{% include JB/setup %}<p>Lately we’ve been getting a lot of questions on how to integrate Facebook and Twitter with Buddy on iOS, so we decided to build to samples to illustrate how this is done.Currently with iOS 5 it’s easier to talk to Twitter then Facebook because of the deep Twitter integration with the OS, however both samples should be straightforward.At the most basic level both apps try to get your Facebook/Twitter information and then check for a Buddy username with the same name as the account on Facebook or Twitter.If the name is not found they create a new user with the same account name and the password set to the hash of the account ID.To configure the samples, take a look at the README file in the top-level directory of each sample.</p>
