<p>Tizen is an open source platform residing within the Linux Foundation.It includes an operating system which can runÂ smartphones, tablets, netbooks, onboard devices in smart cars as well as smart TVs.We wanted to see what it would take to integrate a Tizen app with Backendless because the benefits of such integration would be huge.For instance, data can be easily shared between different implementations of an app: a Tizen version of the app can easily communicate with the one running on Android or iOS by the means of Backendless service APIs.We put together two examples, which originally came from the Tizen SDK.</p>
