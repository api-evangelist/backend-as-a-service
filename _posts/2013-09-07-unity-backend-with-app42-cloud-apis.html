<p>At ShepHertz our focus is to help the App Developers by providing a complete Ecosystem for App and Game developers.With AppWarp Unity SDK being launched and widely accepted next logical step was launching complete backend APIs with Unity.Now using App42 Cloud API, developers can now add social leaderboard, buddy management and you can also save your JSON data on the cloud.These APIs will support iOS, Android and Unity Web Player.We have created a sample project that illustrates how to integrate App42 APIs and get started.</p>
