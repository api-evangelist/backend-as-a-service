{% include JB/setup %}<p>A few months ago mobile gaming backend as a service provider OpenFeint was acquired by GREE and many of its users were left high and dry with their games facing “poor performance” if they didn’t shift to GREE’s somewhat more expensive platform.At the time we at Kumulos (Backend as a Service) wrote about the story and also invited any developers in need of a similar Mobile Backend as a Service platform to join us on our on Mobile Backend.Well, a few months later and OpenFeint has risen from the ashes as OpenKit, an open-source Mobile Backend for games.Announced in December, the project is nearly ready to launch into private beta with 50 developers being initially involved in making everything work.At first they had assumed that they would get a small amount of interest but with 160 developers signing up on the first day and now at 500 and climbing, there’s clearly a strong market out there for their version of a Mobile Backend as a Service.</p>
