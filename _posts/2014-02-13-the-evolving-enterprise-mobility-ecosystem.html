<p>Enterprise mobility is a classic IT disruptor.It’s the kind of disruptor that companies like IBM, Oracle and VMware, SAP, Salesforce, etc.were built on. It may look like a peripheral part of IT infrastructure now, but since mobile will be the primary access point to apps and data for many enterprises, many — if not most — new apps are going to be “mobile first.” Thus, the entire IT infrastructure is going to have to become very mobile friendly, very quickly, or else risk becoming a legacy platform.</p>
