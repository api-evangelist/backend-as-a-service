<p>Just like in the fable about Isaac Newton, sometimes a great idea hits us on the head while weâ€™re going about our daily lives.This was the case for app developer Jacob Hull, who had the idea for his app, Recipe Cloud, after cooking a meal for a friend.Tell us about yourself, Jacob.Until recently I was a Rocket Scientist at Space Systems Loral.I left Loral because I needed to bring the awesome Recipe Cloud into the world.</p>
