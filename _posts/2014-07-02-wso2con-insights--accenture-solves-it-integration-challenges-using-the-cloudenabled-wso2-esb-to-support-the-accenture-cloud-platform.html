<p>As the world’s largest independent technology and outsourcing services provider for nearly 25 years, Accenture has extensive experience in helping global clients navigate through the complex cloud choices in the market.Igor Mameshin, a manager within the Accenture Cloud Platform (ACP), explained in a presentation at WSO2Con US 2013, how the company is using WSO2 technology to help address today’s cloud demands.Mameshin explained that, as companies use hybrid cloud integration—combining private computing resources and public services with integration touch points between the two environments—new and more complex risks arise.For Accenture, the solution was to build a cloud-based infrastructure that accelerates the successful adoption and integration of cloud services, without compromising quality, standards or security.The Accenture Cloud Platform, powered by WSO2’s enterprise middleware platform, Mameshin explained, provides a rich portfolio of application adapters that simplify the connectivity to external systems such as ERP applications like SAP, Salesforce.</p>
