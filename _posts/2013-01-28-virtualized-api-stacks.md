{% include JB/setup %}<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API.But as the number of public APIs has grown beyond 8K, and an unknown amount of internal and partner APIs become available, we are seeing new patterns of aggregation and interoperability emerge from companies like Singly, but also seeing automation be added into the mix by companies like Temboo, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse.These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see backend as a service providers (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me).If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like Kinvey or Parse, or if I need personal and social resources, which have become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps, I can go to Singly.But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for education?I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12?I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge.While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization.Not just the virtualization we&rsquo;ve come to depend on with cloud computing--which is the virtualization of compute, storage, and database resources, but the virtualization of network resources and software defined networking.</p>
