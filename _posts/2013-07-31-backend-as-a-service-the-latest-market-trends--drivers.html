<p>The global backend as a service (BaaS) market is set for phenomenal growth between now and 2016.The key driver in the adoption of BaaS technologies is the need to make app development less complex.Today we want to explore some of the factors that are creating this demand, such as the vast influx of smartphone and tablet devices.As consumers increasingly shift from desktop PCâ€™s (sales have been down 15% on average, every year for the past 5 years) to mobile, the demand for mobile apps has skyrocketed.As the demand for mobile apps and devices continues to explode, so too does the demand for BaaS technologies like Kumulos that make the whole app development process so much more intuitive and quick.</p>
