<p>Charged with developing mobile and web apps on all major platforms that will attract both new and existing users, Leonardo oversees the development of mobile apps for FIC brands.Beginning with a focus in Latin America, the team has developed two apps that use Parse Push to keep their audiences engaged.Inspired by the success of a 2010 World Cup Facebook game built in partnership with Three Melons that had 17M installs in 6 months, the team adjusted to the new mobile market with Fox Sports Review.A soccer game built on Unity and available on Facebook (and coming to iOS and Android in April), the app lets you re-play the best goals in history.The second app is a companion to Copa Bridgestone Libertadores, the most popular club soccer tournament in Latin America.</p>
