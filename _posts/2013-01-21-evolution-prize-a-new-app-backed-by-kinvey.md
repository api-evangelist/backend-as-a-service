 • It was created to solve a data mining problem in the health care industry
 • One user will be awarded $1 million for creating a winning solution in the app
 • Users can run the app while they’re asleep to generate solutions
 The inspiration for Evolution Prize was a competition on Kaggle, a platform for predictive modeling competitions.</p>
