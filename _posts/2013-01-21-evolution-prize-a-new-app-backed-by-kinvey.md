{% include JB/setup %}<p>We’ve started a new blog series called “Our Favorite Apps.” Every now and again, we’ll showcase an awesome app backed by Kinvey.You can see our first post here.This week, we’re highlighting an app called Evolution Prize.Why We Love Evolution Prize
 • It was created to solve a data mining problem in the health care industry
 • One user will be awarded $1 million for creating a winning solution in the app
 • Users can run the app while they’re asleep to generate solutions
 The inspiration for Evolution Prize was a competition on Kaggle, a platform for predictive modeling competitions.The Heritage Provider Network Health Prize (HPNHP) is offering a cool $3 million to the creator of an algorithm that accurately predicts how many days a patient will spend in a hospital next year.This two-year competition hopes to increase patients’ health and reduce care costs by better planning.Tony Travers, an indie developer from Melbourne, developed a crowdsourcing app to submit to the HPNHP contest.In the app, users become problem solvers by predicting hospital stays.The app is a form of genetic programming that mimics how researchers believe evolution works.</p>
