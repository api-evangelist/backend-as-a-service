{% include JB/setup %}<p>Building off of its global leadership in mobile push messaging, Urban Airship today detailed its expanded strategic focus on delivering Mobile Relationship Management (MRM) solutions that enable brands and marketers to earn and maintain a presence on their customers mobile devices.More than a new category of technology solutions, MRM signals a massive shift from businesses traditional focus on paid media and interruption-based marketing tactics towards owned media such as apps and digital wallet initiatives that create a directly addressable audience by putting the customer in control.Businesses are navigating uncharted waters in delivering engaging, relevant and valuable experiences to earn mobile loyalty and the pressure to keep pace with customer adoption is massive.The new strategic services and solution enhancements unveiled by Urban Airship today promise to make the move to MRM easier and relationship-building initiatives more engaging and effective.According to Forrester Research, In 2013, the ultra-connected customer base will continue to grow at a staggering pace, destabilizing marketing as youve come to know it.These customers demand personalized, relevant attention, designed around their needs and wants rather than around your marketing channels.If you dont change the way you think about engaging these customers, you will quickly lose relevance (2013 Interactive Marketing Predictions, Forrester Research, Inc., 2/11/2013).During the past year, Urban Airship has experienced incredible growth and made significant investments to accelerate its leadership position in offering a broad range of solutions -- from precision location-targeted push messaging to Apple® Passbook® management -- that enable brands to grow stronger relationships with mobile consumers and gain competitive advantage.As the company executes on its Mobile Relationship Management strategy, it will:
Add sophisticated business-user oriented capabilities to its cross-platform solutions with some key areas of focus including advanced analytics, location, marketing automation and expanded data integrations to extend marketing and CRM systems in the enterprise onto the consumers mobile devices
Offer strategic professional services for customer engagement best practices and expert technical services married to customers mobile launches for optimal results out-of-the-gate
Expand its ecosystem of strategic partners, technology platforms and agencies focused on solving businesses core objectives in engaging customers, partners and employees
With more mobile devices than people on the planet, it is critical that organizations move quickly into this new world by putting the consumer front-and-center, said Peter Roybal, head of mobile product management at ABC News Digital.</p>
