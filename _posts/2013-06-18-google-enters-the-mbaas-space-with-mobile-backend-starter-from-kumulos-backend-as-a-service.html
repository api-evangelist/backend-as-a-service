<p>Google are a company that seem to be on an ever expanding quest outward in the tech world.They are slowly bringing together a host of disparate but connected services under the one multi-coloured banner of Mountain View.For some this may seem like a slowly growing monopoly attempt, but for the majority of us it only spells good things.Gmail has long established itself as one of the best email clients out there, and Googleâ€™s cloud services have managed to separate themselves from the herd of other providers by being as useful as they are simple to use, mostly.With that in mind, Google have recently announced that they are moving into the Mobile Backend as a Service market.</p>
