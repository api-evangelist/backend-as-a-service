<p>Today we announced that Kinvey has raised $10.8 million in a Series B financing round, driven by new investors Verizon Ventures and NTT DOCOMO Ventures, and joined by existing investors Avalon Ventures and Atlas Venture.This financing brings Kinvey’s total amount raised to date to $17.8M.This is a big step for us, and I’m proud to see how far this company has come.</p>
