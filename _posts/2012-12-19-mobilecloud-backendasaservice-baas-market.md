{% include JB/setup %}<p>Backend as a Service (BaaS) is a middleware service which is similar to Platform as a Service.In BaaS, the application developer outsources the creation of backend, server side programming and the development of server side code blocks to a third party service provider called a BaaS provider.In addition to this, BaaS providers provide data storage, ready to integrate features like push notifications, social media integration, Application usage analytics, User management, SDK , APIs, etc.BaaS provides several advantages to it users like reduction in the development time and deployment time to market; reduction in complexities and redundancies of the application development process; minimal initial investment required for application development.The Backend as a Service (BaaS) market research report covers computing platforms, vertical segments, end users types, geographical analysis,  worldwide trends, market forces, technology & market roadmaps, business models, adoption factors, and company profiles for key industry players in the BaaS market space.MARKETS COVERED
