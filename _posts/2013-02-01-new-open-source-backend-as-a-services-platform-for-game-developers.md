{% include JB/setup %}<p>A new player in the Backend as a Service (BaaS) space has emerged, from former OpenFeint co-founder Peter Relan--called OpenKit.&nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android.&nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:

Cloud data sync - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage.Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience
Leaderboards - Drop-in leaderboard SDKs for both iOS and Android.Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players
Facebook &amp; Twitter auth - Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter.No need to create and manage accounts.OpenKit handles it all
Cross-platform support - OpenKit supports both iOS and Android.Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game

OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or virtualized stacks targeting specific groups of developers.Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps.So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.</p>
