 WebRTC and Firefox Marketplace (along with Firefox OS).  Very important â€“ watch this space seeing how web is starting to play a bigger role with better browser, OS and mobile integration.  For the mobile cloud backends world there is a very good roundup by Miko Matsumura: Series A Crunch Will Wash Out Small MBaaS Mobile Backend-as-a-Service Providers.  Lots of useful detail and some forecast.
