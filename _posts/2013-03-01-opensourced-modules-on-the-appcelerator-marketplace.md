{% include JB/setup %}<p>Open source software is a core part of the Titanium product, with both the SDK and Alloy available in this manner.Today we have a thriving community of over 425,000 developers, many of which are actively contributing to the software.It’s on this topic that I’m pleased to announce two major updates regarding the Appcelerator Marketplace Modules.1.Open-sourcing of 24 Appcelerator Marketplace Modules
 Effective immediately, we have open sourced the following 24 Appcelerator modules:
 This will allow members of the community the ability to contribute, improve and advance these modules – just as you can with Titanium SDK and Alloy.These modules will continue to be accessible through the Appcelerator Marketplace (with a link to the open source code) and you will still be informed when updates are available.The only difference is that both the development community, as well as Appcelerator’s internal developers, will be able to provide enhancements to these modules.If you are currently paying a monthly or annual fee for any of the above-mentioned modules, moving forward you will no longer be charged.2.Publishing of Open-source Modules on the Appcelerator Marketplace 
 I am also pleased to announce that module developers can now officially publish their own open sourced modules in the Appcelerator Marketplace.</p>
