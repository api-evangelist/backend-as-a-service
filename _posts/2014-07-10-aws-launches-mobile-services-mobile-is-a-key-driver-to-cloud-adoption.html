<p>With AWS’s announcement of their mobile services today, I’d like to formally welcome Amazon to the Backend as a service (MBaaS) neighborhood.In the last year, Microsoft (via Azure Mobile Services), Salesforce.com, and now Amazon have joined companies like Kinvey and Parse in the MBaaS space, which goes to show the size of the market we are pursuing.Every startup likes to play the “this validates our market” card when a large vendor moves into their space, but this move really does illustrate the speed at which the MBaaS market is growing.As I noted in Barb Darrow’s story in GigaOm, both Kinvey and Parse were built on AWS, and we’ve partnered with them on various fronts.</p>
