<p>When I joined Parse in early 2012, I didn’t even know what an SDK was.I wasn’t there to build the product, though, just to support the engineers and keep the office running so they could keep building.I knew we were making mobile app development easier, and that was good enough for me.Over the next year, my Parse family taught me, as they’re so good at doing, all about the mobile world.I began to understand how revolutionary our product was, literally helping to change the landscape of app development.</p>
