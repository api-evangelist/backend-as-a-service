<p>At Kinvey we frequently work directly with organizations on their mobile development projects, but we also have a rich ecosystem of development partners who use the Kinvey platform to build apps for their own clients.One of our partners, OhmzTech, brought to our attention a story that we think illustrates the value – sometimes even unexpected – that a robust enterprise MBaaS platform can bring to the table.OhmzTech’s client, a major international auto manufacturer, has showrooms around the world.The client’s corporate office sends representatives to the distributed showrooms to ensure that they are in line with company standards.Their existing way of accomplishing this – representatives reporting via a series of unsorted emails containing notes and photos, which then needed to be collated by the corporate office – was inefficient and a major drain on time and resources.</p>
