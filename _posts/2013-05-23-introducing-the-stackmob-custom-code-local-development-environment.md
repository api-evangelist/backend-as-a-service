{% include JB/setup %}<p>At StackMob, we share a core belief that a mobile application performs at its best when your logic is close to your data.That core belief drives our custom code module.We provide a high performance infrastructure inside which you run your own code to manipulate your app’s data, and do a variety of other tasks within your StackMob app.We’re continually working to make development as pain free as possible, which is why we’ve taken strides to release the StackMob Custom Code Local Development Environment.The flip side of having your logic close to the data, is that debugging custom code can be challenging.</p>
