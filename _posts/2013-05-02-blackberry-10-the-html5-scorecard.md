{% include JB/setup %}<p>In our last HTML5 scorecard, we took a look at the Microsoft Surface vs.the iPad gen4 and gave our nod to the iPad as the best HTML5 platform on tablets.This time, weâ€™re putting the just launched BlackBerry Z10 running the new BlackBerry 10 OS through the test wringer.Going in, we were expecting very good things from the Z10.Last year, we gave a thumbs up to the Playbook OS2 HTML5 experience, and had good experiences with pre-release versions of the Z10 when developing Sencha Touch 2.</p>
