<p>Ext JS provides a lot of built-in components right out of the box that are highly customizable.If itâ€™s not in the framework, you can easily extend the classes or even browse Sencha Market for anything you might need.That works great most of the time, but sometimes you might want to use a 3rd party library that is not built using the Ext JS component system.There are a number of ways you can address this situation, but the easiest one is to create a custom wrapper component to handle your library, which can be reused across any of your apps.The goal of your wrapper component is to encapsulate the logic required by the 3rd party library to set itself up and interact with the Ext JS framework.</p>
