<p>We heard your feedback and a new refined data browser with redesigned UI is available now on the Kii Developer Portal.Log in to check it out (click your application, the Objects icon and then Data Browser).With Kii Data Browser, view all objects created and stored in any bucket within your app at any scope, and build queries to examine the data in different ways.If you’re not familiar with bucket scoping, check out one of our guides: iOS | Android |</p>
