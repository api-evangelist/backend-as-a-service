<p>We recently introduced our Custom Code Local Development environment so you can write and test custom code without having to compile and upload JAR files to StackMob.Today, I am going to show you how to get up and running.Weâ€™ve added the local dev code and dependencies to our Custom Code Java Examples github repo.Download or Clone the Repo IntelliJ by JetBrains is our preferred IDE at StackMob (check it out, there is a free community edition).Of course, you are free to use other IDEs as well.</p>
