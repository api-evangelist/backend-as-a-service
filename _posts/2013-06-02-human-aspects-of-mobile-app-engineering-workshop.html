<p>As our experiences with webinos have taught us, mobile devices are no longer simply a means of communication; they have gradually becoming supporting devices for day-to-day tasks.By 2020, it has been predicted that all software will be developed for mobile devices and this implies it is necessary to explore the issues involved in the design, development, and deployment of mobile applications.On September 9th, we will — in conjunction with our colleagues at Oxford Brookes university — be organising a workshop on the human implications of building mobile apps at the British HCI 2013 conference in London.The Human Aspects in Mobile Applications Engineering workshop brings together researchers from industry and academia in order to explore the challenges and opportunities presented by incorporating human aspects in mobile apps engineering.The topics addressed by HAMAE2013 include, but are not limited to:
 • Empirical studies informing mobile app design
 • Behavioural research on the use of mobile apps
 • Mobile applications usability evaluation: studies and techniques
 • Social and cultural aspects in mobile app engineering
 • Studies of mobile app stores
 • Development models in mobile app engineering
 • Reports on development cycles of mobile apps
 • Non-functional aspects (i.</p>
