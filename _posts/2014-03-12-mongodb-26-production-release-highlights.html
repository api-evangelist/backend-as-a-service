<p>The Parse platform relies heavily on MongoDB.We use MongoDB for a variety of workloads, such as routing and storing application data, monitoring, real-time API request performance analysis, and billing and backend platform analytics.We love the flexibility and richness of the feature set that MongoDB provides, as well as the rock-solid high availability and primary elections.So we are incredibly excited about the upcoming MongoDB 2.6.</p>
