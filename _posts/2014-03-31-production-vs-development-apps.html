<p>It’s a very common use-case to have apps built on Parse that are both still in development and already in production.To help you make a clear distinction between Development Apps and Production Apps, we’re adding a switch in your app’s settings that lets you mark an app as a Production App.This will not only allow you to visually differentiate between your production apps and those still in development mode, but will in the future allow us to add security features that prevent you from accidentally editing content that is in production, or sending test push notifications to actual users (“Whoops!”).</p>
