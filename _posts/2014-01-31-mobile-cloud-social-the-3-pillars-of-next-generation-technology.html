<p>After reading the book The Big Switch by Nicholas Carr 5 years ago I was sold on his stipulation that the harnessing of electricity during the industrial revolution was a predictive analog of the path of utility computing.  Fast-forward to the present and every prediction Mr.Carr made has not only been accurate, but has been accelerated by at least 50% by my estimation.  As an “old infrastructure guy”, I knew my days in that market were numbered and a change needed to be made.Cloud computing came along and out of seemingly nowhere is already a $150B market.</p>
