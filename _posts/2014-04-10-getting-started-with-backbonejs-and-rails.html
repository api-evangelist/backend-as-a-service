<p>I recently started using Backbone.js with my existing web application and have found it to be extremely useful for keeping all my Javascript front-end code organized.As my application has a complicated user interface, I realized my JavaScript code was getting out of control and was tough to maintain due to lack of structure.This forced me to look for options with which I could keep my code clean and in a structured way.And I found there are many JS frameworks that attempt to offer similar benefits, like Backbone.</p>
