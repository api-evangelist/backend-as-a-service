<p>With RestXpress enterprises can easily expose databases and business applications securely via REST.Â Once exposed as REST services, they can easily be integrated into Appery.io apps.Deployed behind the firewall, RESTXpress comes in two easy-to-install parts.An administrative console (running in a browser) easily sets up enterprise assets as REST services and a run-time gateway presents the enterprise assets as services to the outside world.</p>
