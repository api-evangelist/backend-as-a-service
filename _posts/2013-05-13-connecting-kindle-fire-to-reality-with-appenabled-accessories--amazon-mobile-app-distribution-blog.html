<p>Mobile devices create an amazing ecosystem for developers to express new ideas, create new business, and expand existing worlds.Services like GameCircle and In-App Purchasing make those experiences more sticky and re-playable, drawing users into the experience with more depth.Another category of ecosystem depth that weve been focusing on is app-enabled accessories.Kindle Fire (as well as other Android devices) can connect to and control an incredible range of new devices, and a couple weeks ago we launched a few of these devices on Amazon.com as official Kindle accessories, creating new ways and new opportunities for developers to connect with Amazon customers.</p>
