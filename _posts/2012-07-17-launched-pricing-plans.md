{% include JB/setup %}<p>Today were launching the pricing plan for CloudyRec, one step closer to official launch.Basically, using CloudyRec during development and user testing period will be FREE.Only when you launch your app and open access to pubilc, youll switch to use our Pro Plan costing $9.90 per month per app.Well make sure that migration will also be painless and as streamlined as possible.For that $9.90 Pro Plan, youll get up to 2 million API requests per month plus 2 GB multimedia file storage.Therell be additional charges of 8Â¢ per 10,000 API requests over and 1$ per 5GB over storage space.But not to worry, if you think these additional costs are too much for your great app, we can always sort out a custom plan for your app.Just drop a mail to sales@cloudyrec.</p>
