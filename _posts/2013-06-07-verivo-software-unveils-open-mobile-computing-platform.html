<p>Just about every enterprise IT organization to one degree or another is struggling with mobile computing to one degree or another, especially when it comes to integrating the applications that run on devices with existing backend enterprise services.To help organizations address that issue across multiple mobile computing environment, Verivo Software this week launched Verivo Akula, an open mobile computing platform that creates a common enterprise computing backend for developers of mobile computing applications.According to Verivo CEO Steve Levy, there is no shortage of mobile application development environments that will connect a mobile application to a backend enterprise service.The trouble is that those environments usually require the IT organization to commit to a single mobile computing application environment.Given the volatility of mobile computing it not particularly practical for most IT organizations to standardize on one development platform, which he says means it was on a matter of time before providers of mobile development environments moved to open their backend platforms to multiple development tools.</p>
