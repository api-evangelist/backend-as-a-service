<p>Cloud Modules are an easy way for you to enhance your app through integration with third-party services.Parse has packaged modules that you can use for emailing, text messaging, or even payments.We realize that there are many more services out there which you and other developers may want to integrate with but Parse doesn’t officially support.We’d like to find a home where these integrations can be shared with the community.Now individual developers and companies can contribute Cloud Modules that will be listed on Parse and shared with our developer community.</p>
