<p>Alex: Tell me about yourself.Sravish: I grew up in the Southern part of India, and I got my first computer when I was seven years old, and I started writing code using a cassette tape.I started getting better computers every year, and I had my first formal computer science class when I was 14.My mom was a geek, she still is.She has even more electronics in the house than I do.</p>
