<p>Time to take the beta tag off!We’re very excited to announce that we are now sporting a shiny new community — the Community Forum.We believe this is a very big and important step in the life of a developer platform like ours.We looked at what makes developer forums successful and learned some important lessons from companies that are doing it well, like Stack Overflow, AWS and others.Providing a forum in which developers can interact both with Kinvey staff as well as one another shifts the support experience from a closed, 1-to-1 format, and instead creates a knowledge base for everyone.</p>
