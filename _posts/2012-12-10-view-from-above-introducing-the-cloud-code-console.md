{% include JB/setup %}<p>Cloud Code allows you to upload and run custom app code in the Parse Cloud.We want to keep building tools to improve your developer experience, so we’re excited to add a Cloud Code Console on our website to help you keep track of what’s currently in your Parse Cloud.You can access it from the applications console.After you run your next parse deploy
, you should see your new code reflected in the Cloud Code Console.Remember you can always print log messages from Cloud Code to help you debug, and you will see those entries in this console as well.</p>
