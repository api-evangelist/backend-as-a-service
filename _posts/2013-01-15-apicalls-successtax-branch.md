{% include JB/setup %}<p>@StackMobSteve â€¦ but you charge for features.In the end, everyone charges for something.Its business!@AAinslie @fdestin @sarahintampa 
 
  Very cool service.Havent used it before.Apologize in advance for delays in responding.Branch was a very good idea Alexander.My only point is that Tys implication that his no charge per API call was unique to StackMob was a little misleading, thats all.If a developer prefers to pay by number of users, our model may work for them; if someone would rather buy features, then StackMob may make more sense.Its all good.</p>
