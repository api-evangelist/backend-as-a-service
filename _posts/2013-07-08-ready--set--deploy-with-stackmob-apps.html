<p>At StackMob, we are proud of our development workflow.This workflow includes integrated SDK download and configuration guide when creating your StackMob app, a marketplace to add functionality to your application and separate development and production environments.It is the separate environments that allows Stackmob to offer multiple concurrent APIs in production through the use of API snapshots and ensure backwards compatibility of your app over time.We’ve created three new screencasts to show how easy it is to deploy your API as well as HTML5 Hosted app to production.To get you started, let’s see how to install the HTML5 Hosting module and use GitHub to deploy your JavaScript app to the development environment.</p>
