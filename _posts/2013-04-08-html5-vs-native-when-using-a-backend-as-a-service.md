{% include JB/setup %}<p>Earlier this month, Parse sponsored and presented two talks at HTML5 Developer Conference in San Francisco at The Palace Hotel.We really enjoyed interacting with a few thousand members of the HTML5 community and were proud that both of our talks were positively received.One of these talks, by Parse engineer Bryan Klimt, took an in-depth look at the benefits and challenges of HTML5 versus Native when using a backend as a service, like Parse.See the full video below or take a look at a PDF of the slides and script.On Wednesday, May 1st we’ll be giving a live screencast of Parse engineer Mattieu Gamache-Asselin’s talk from HTML5 Developer Conference.</p>
