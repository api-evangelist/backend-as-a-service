<p>    As more and more consumers hold their “computer” in their hand rather than on their lap or use a venerable desktop version, the pressure on enterprises to improve/refine/perfect their active connection to these increasingly mobile consumers becomes ever more important.  For many businesses, commerce happens in a much more real-time and immediate manner than ever before and the ability to access those mobile consumers and influence their purchase decisions require that their digital access points be built for mobile.  Sadly, too few companies at this point are designing and developing business applications with the mobile interface as the primary design driver.  Traditional PC-based application development still rules over a “mobile first” strategy.A “mobile first” approach is where new websites and applications are designed for mobile devices first, instead of initially designed for laptops and desktops.</p>
