{% include JB/setup %}<p>The Parse SDK for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 makes it easy to build sophisticated apps.Parse allows you to securely store data, manage users, and more, in just a few lines of code without ever worrying about servers.Today, we’re excited to announce Microsoft will be joining us to present a webcast series that will help developers get acquainted with the Parse SDK for Windows Phone.For our first webcast, Parse Software Engineer David Poll will show you how to get started building Windows & Windows Phone apps using Parse.David is a Microsoft alumnus who first became interested in framework development working for Microsoft’s Silverlight team, where he gained a healthy appreciation for the nuances of building software for other developers to consume.At Parse, he has been responsible for launching the Parse SDK for both Windows 8 & Windows Phone 8 within hours of the launch of each platform.Along with David, we’ll have Jean-Christophe Cimetiere, Director for Windows Phone partner & developer programs, joining the webcast from Microsoft.Jean-Christophe will give a detailed discussion of Windows & Windows Phone Store opportunities, tips for developers to engage with more users, and an overview of live tiles, store trials, lock screen, and more.At the end of the webcast, there will be a Q&A session during which David and Jean-Christophe will answer audience submitted questions.To register for Getting Started Building Windows Apps Using Parse at 10:30 AM PT on March 28th, 2013, click here.</p>
