{% include JB/setup %}<p>Search is really easy to implement for a quick and dirty prototype, but really hard to implement in a scalable way for production usage.The patterns that work most conveniently for prototyping are often the direct cause of scalability problems later in an application’s life cycle.Simplistic search algorithms simply scan through all the documents and execute the query on each one. If it sounds like this can take a long time, that’s because it does.The key to making searches run efficiently is to minimize the number of documents that have to be examined when executing each query by using an index. To do that you need to keep in mind what kinds of queries you want to support when designing how to organize your data. The more structured and limited these queries are, the easier this will be.One of the big advantages of using a service like Parse is that you don’t have to worry about managing your own database and maintaining indexes.We’ve built an abstraction for you so that we manage all of that complexity for you, and you can focus on your application’s unique features.To organize your data model to support efficient searching, you’ll need to know a bit about how our systems are operating behind the abstraction.</p>
