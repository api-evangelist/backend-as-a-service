<p>Over the past few months, we’ve been building towards a stronger, lighter and faster backend for our developers to use in their apps.We now have over 5,000 developers signed up and hooked in to our backend service.We host over 458,000 users (and growing fast!) as well as handle over 50 million calls to our API.And that’s on the free tier alone!</p>
