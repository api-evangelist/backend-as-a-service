<p>Keeping airplanes in the air and operating safely and efficiently is the job of Boeing’s commercial aviation division—specifically, the service known as Boeing Edge, which provides support and service to the manufacturer’s aviation customer base.As Boeing senior product manager Jim Crabbe explained at WSO2Con US 2013, providing this level of agile, informed service, and allowing customers to share information among many disparate systems, brought about the need for platform as a service (PaaS), which is powered by WSO2 software.“Our Boeing Edge solutions need to help customers’ planes spend less time on the ground, and more time in the air,” Crabbe said.“For airlines, time is of the essence, and creating operational efficiency requires connecting people, processes, and sources of data.” 
Boeing’s job, Crabbe explained, is to reduce the complexity of these mission-critical processes.</p>
