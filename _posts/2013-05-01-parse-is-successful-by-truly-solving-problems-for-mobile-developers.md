<p>I dont personally use Parse or any other backend as a service (BaaS) provider to build mobile applications.Im just playing role as analyst when it comes to the backend as a service space, but I am a developer so I can tell when any technology provider is speaking to developers or just marketing and hockn their wares.Each week I monitor the tech blogosphere, the API space and where it has expanded into the backend as a service space and driving mobile development.I pull 300 + feeds from random blogs and 700+ feeds from APIs providers.I see the contrast between what Techrunch, GigaOm and NextWeb produce alongside what API and BaaS providers publish to their blogs.</p>
