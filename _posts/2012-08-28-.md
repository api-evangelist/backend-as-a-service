{% include JB/setup %}<p><p><img src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mobile-backend-as-a-service/Mobile+Backend+as+a+Service.png alt= width=250 align=right />I did a <a title=roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers href=/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/>roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers</a> last week, which brought in a couple recommendations of other companies I should include, and some interesting feedback on how APIs can be integrated with MBaaS platforms.</p>
<p>A very interesting comment left on the post was about MBaaS vendor lock-in:</p>
<blockquote><em>The big problem, IMHO, using a BaaS provider is the so called vendor lock in.What if my backend provider changes the pricing models, or dismisses the service and go out of the business?</em></blockquote>
<p>To address this issue, the commenter said they are building an open source MBaaS platform, which anyone will be able to download and install on the server or cloud platform of their choice.</p>
<p>Just like with the recent addition of an <a title=open source api management platform href=http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/19/the-100-open-source-api-platform-i-was-looking-for/>open source API management platform</a>, I think an open source Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) would benefit the space tremendously.</p>
<p>The new open source MBaaS is called BaaSBox, and is in early development.</p>
