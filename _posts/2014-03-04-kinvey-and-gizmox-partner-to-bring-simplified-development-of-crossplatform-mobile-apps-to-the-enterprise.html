<p>At Kinvey we’re all about empowering developers to create, test, and deploy mobile apps faster and easier, and we’ve always been fans of software and tools that support this mission.Today we’re excited to announce the integration of Kinvey with Gizmox’s Visual WebGui HTML5 platform.Gizmox’s platform allows developers to build apps using familiar languages and tools like C#, VB.net, and Visual Studio.They can then deploy these apps as native-quality, cross-platform HTML5 or hybrid applications that run on any device.</p>
