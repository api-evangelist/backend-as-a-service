<p>Getting to your data is an important part of many application development flows.Whether you need to perform additional analysis on your data, back it up, or duplicate it in a different Parse app, exporting quickly becomes a crucial piece of your development toolkit.Over the last few weeks, we’ve greatly improved the performance of exports, ensured that our export system could handle even the largest apps, and added some neat UI features to improve the overall experience.For larger apps, it’s not very convenient to export and download all of your data if you really just need one or two collections.To help with this, we’ve added a menu item in the data browser that will allow you to export a single collection.</p>
