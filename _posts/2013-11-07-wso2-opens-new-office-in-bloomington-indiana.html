<p>The sun never sets on WSO2.  With more and more customers relying on our 24×7 support for their critical WSO2 deployments, it makes sense to rebalance our support function more evenly around the world.  Adding a new facility in Bloomington ensures we continue to provide timely responses and resolutions to support requests, at the same time reducing the midnight oil burned in Colombo on occasion.Located in the US Eastern Time Zone, convenient to travel to many destinations in throughout the US.Indiana University Bloomington has one of the largest and most prestigious Computer Science and Informatics programs in the nation.</p>
