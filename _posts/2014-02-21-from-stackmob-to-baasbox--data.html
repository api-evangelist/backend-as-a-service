<p>After a while, you should receive an email from StackMob with a link to a zip file.The zip file contains a.json file for each schema defined in StackMob some other files relating to plugins and/or other functions.For each data schema defined in StackMob, you will find a JSON file named <schema_name>.json
 In this example the file you want to import is product.</p>
