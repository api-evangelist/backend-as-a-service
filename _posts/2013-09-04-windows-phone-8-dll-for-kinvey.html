<p>A few weeks ago, if a developer using Kinvey asked me about a Windows native library, my response would have been “Sorry, we don’t have that yet, just use the REST API, or maybe an HTML5 app is right for you.” But now, thanks to the amazing efforts of the fabulous mobile software development company, Penrillian, there is a Windows Phone 8 DLL for Kinvey!This is great news for developers that are looking for the advantages of doing native development and also want the ease of simply implementing a library in order to provide their app’s backend.From the Penrillian blog, Pete Martin wrote: “The idea is that you simply drop the DLL into your Windows Phone project, initialize it with you app key and secret, and you have a range of service classes available to connect, modify and query your cloud data without needing to write any of the plumbing, understand the Windows Phone Http Client, or understand how Kinvey’s HTTP interface works.” At Kinvey, we are so excited that partners like Penrillian are building out functionality for our platform.</p>
