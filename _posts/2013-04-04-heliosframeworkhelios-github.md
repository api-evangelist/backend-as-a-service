{% include JB/setup %}<p>Helios is an open-source framework that provides essential backend services for iOS apps, from data synchronization and user accounts to push notifications, in-app purchases, and passbook integration.It allows developers to get a client-server app up-and-running in just a few minutes, and seamlessly incorporate functionality as necessary.Helios is designed for mobile first development.Build out great features on the device, and implement the server-side components as necessary.Pour all of your energy into crafting a great user experience, rather than getting mired down with the backend.One great example of this philosophy in Helios is Core Data Synchronization.This allows you to use your existing Core Data model definition to automatically generate a REST webservice, which can be used to shuttle data between the server and client.No iCloud, no problem.Helios also comes with a Web UI.Browse and search through all of your database records, push notification registrations, in-app purchases, and passbook passes.</p>
