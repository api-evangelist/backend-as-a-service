<p>BURLINGAME, CA--(Marketwired - May 10, 2013) -  In anticipation of Google IO, Peter Relans open source, open data alternative to OpenFeint, OpenKit, announced today that the cloud-based platform & service will let developers create social gaming interactions across all gaming services on mobile platforms.OpenKit plans to let developers add smart social invites and game data sharing across mobile platforms so that developers can leverage smart invites to detect the receivers device and open up discovery across iOS and Android.Â OpenKit, which currently has over 1,200 developers testing the service in beta, will add other cross-platform social features before June.With open source and open data, our mission is to remove any friction for developers using our service, said Peter Relan who sponsored OpenFeint and now OpenKit.We are doubling down on this theme of removing friction: recognizing that iOS and Android devices are equally prevalent amongst users, we will let them interact socially with each other across walled gardens, regardless of whether they use an Android device or iOS device, or even both.</p>
