<p>Login to Backendless console and create a new application called OrderManagement.You can use an existing application, however this guide assumes that certain data tables are created, which may conflict in an existing app.Use caution if you decide to use an existing app. Click the “plus” icon in the lower left corner of the screen to add a new table.The reason a table should be created first is because one of the next steps will be registering an event handler for this table.</p>
