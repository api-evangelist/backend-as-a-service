{% include JB/setup %}<p>App.net has just released a File API to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the backend as a service (BaaS) space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.</p>
