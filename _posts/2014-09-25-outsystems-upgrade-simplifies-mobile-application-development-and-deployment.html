<p>OutSystems this week released a major upgrade to its rapid application development (RAD) environment that makes it easier to deploy native mobile applications that can access a broad range of back-end services.Via a new hybrid mobile capability included in OutSystems Platform 9, developers working from a single code base can deploy applications on a variety of mobile computing platforms without having to sacrifice any native functionality.Enabled by an open source shell, dubbed the OutSystems Now app, the goal is to allow organizations to gain all the efficiencies of working with a single code base while taking full advantage of the capabilities available on Apple iOS, Google Android and Windows Phone mobile applications, says Sean Allen, director of product marketing.Allen says OutSystems Platform 9 also includes a visualization tool that makes it simpler to aggregate and manipulate data.Developers can use that tool to bind and view complex queries in real time using live data, he says.</p>
