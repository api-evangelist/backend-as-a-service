<p>For any of you sceptics doubting the commercial feasibility of backend as a service (BaaS), you should check out Facebook’s acquisition of Parse for a rumoured $85 million.The acquisition enables Facebook to provide their own proprietary backend solution for app and game developers.The integration between Facebook and Parse will enable the social networking company to provide a superior user experience through enhanced responsiveness and reduced latency.Parse has been described as BaaS (backend as a service) and XaaS (everything as a service).If you’re an app developer, this means you can focus on the front-end design and development of your apps and games, without having to worry about setting up a server.</p>
