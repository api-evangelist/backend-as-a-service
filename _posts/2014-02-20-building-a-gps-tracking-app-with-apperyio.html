<p>The GPS location is determined every 15 seconds (you can change the interval).The location is shown in the app and also saved into a cloud database.Because this is a native app (with PhoneGap), the app will continue tracking the location even if in the background or with the phone screen locked.To try this app, download the app backup and create a new app from it. Keep in mind that you do need to build a binary file and install it on the device for testing.</p>
