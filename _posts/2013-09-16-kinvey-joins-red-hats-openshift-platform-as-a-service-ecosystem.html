<p>Today, we are excited to announce that Kinvey is integrating with Red Hat’s OpenShift PaaS, allowing developers to mobilize business-critical data from on-premise or cloud environments into their mobile, tablet and web apps.Kinvey will make it easier for OpenShift customers to integrate securely with their organizations’ on-premise or cloud systems, such as CRM systems or JBoss environments, thereby accelerating development time for advanced mobile apps.An OpenShift cartridge will automate the process of deploying Kinvey’s Data Link connectors, allowing developers to more efficiently extract business-critical data into their apps.Our CEO, Sravish Sridhar, says: “Partnering with OpenShift gives our customers the flexibility to mobilize enterprise backend systems, such as JBoss, using OpenShift’s on-prem and cloud-based PaaS.We’re excited to become a part of their ecosystem, together helping developers build advanced applications.</p>
