<p>Apple and IBM addressed the increasing need for enterprise mobility.Enterprise apps were a hot topic during Apple’s Q3 2014 earnings call on July 22, and with good reason.Prior to its recent earnings release, Apple announced a partnership with IBM on July 15 in an effort to create more than 100 industry-specific enterprise solutions.Some of these included native apps developed exclusively from the ground up for iPhone and iPad.During the earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook repeatedly emphasized the importance of enterprise apps.</p>
