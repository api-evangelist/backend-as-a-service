<p>As telecommunications continue to compete on service, they  look at new ways to enrich the customer experience.For Algar Telecom, one of those ways is enabling customers to create their own Web applications using the popular JavaScript language.At WSO2Con US 2013, Cesar William Alvarenga, front end engineer at Algar Telecom, described how the company  is taking advantage of Jaggery, WSO2’s server-side JavaScript framework for composing Web applications.Building on Initial Success
 Before describing the company’s use of Jaggery, Alvarenga began by talking about the company’s first project using WSO2 software: Algar Telecom OCS (online charging system).OCS is used to charge customers in real-time, based on their service usage, and all mobile and fixed line traffic will run through this platform.</p>
