<p>Today as the mobile devices have more power than our laptops of 10 years ago, we are finding that they indeed have the capability to handle more informational process flow.In addition, with the progress in wireless technology, the modern mobile device is faster using wi-fi than our old technology was with dial-up mode.Now that the front end is ready, it is time to focus on connecting to the back end where the meat and potatoes of business data are located.This is where we find the analytics, business process, business logic and overall business data that are to be communicated within the mobile device of today.So while mobile devices become feature rich, the final piece to bridge the gap between the back end storage and the front end delivery will be the focus on the integration through increased back end system functionality through the use of APIâ€™s or a mBaaS platform like Proxomo.</p>
