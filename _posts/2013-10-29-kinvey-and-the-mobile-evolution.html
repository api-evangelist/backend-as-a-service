<p>The rapid rate of mobile growth never ceases to amaze me.Looking back on some major mobile milestones from the past 13 years truly puts this into perspective:
 March 2000: First 1 GHz Processors available
 June 2007: First iPhone 412 MHz
 July 2008: 500 Apps in Apple App Store
 
At this rate, I can’t help but wonder: Where will we be 5 years out?Here are some of my predictions:
 I believe that the future of personal computing is mobile.I believe that “as-a-service” technologies let app developers focus more on their  customers and lead to better and more useful applications.I believe that mobile computing is poised to revolutionize enterprise applications.</p>
