<p>Yesterday, Kinvey launched Mobile Identity Connect, a service that seamlessly secures mobile, tablet, and responsive Web apps with any enterprise identity system.In today’s enterprise, companies typically have sources of identity spread out in various places, beginning with an LDAP-based corporate identity system.Additionally, many existing enterprise applications have their own security infrastructure and own user management features.Beyond that, many business processes require the use of an external partner or vendor application, or organizations have implemented Software as a Service solutions, all with their own identity needs.This diversity makes the creation of a single canonical source of identity within the Enterprise a difficult endeavor.</p>
