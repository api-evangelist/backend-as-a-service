<p>It’s no secret that customer satisfaction is key to Amazon’s success.It’s something we obsess about, and we constantly tweak everything from product selection to payment options to website design.We experiment, we measure, and we decide whether or not a change improves the user experience.One of the most powerful tools at our disposal is something we call a Web Lab, which allows us to test two (or more) different versions of a webpage, or roll out a new feature to a limited audience.Perhaps this concept is less familiar to mobile application and game developers than to those who write web code, but it shouldn’t be.</p>
