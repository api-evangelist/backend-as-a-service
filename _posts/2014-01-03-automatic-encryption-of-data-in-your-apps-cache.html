<p> Over the last year, we’ve had enterprises from various vertical markets use Kinvey.While working with these customers, we’ve improved our platform to enable enterprise-focused features such as connecting to internal backend systems, auto-versioning of custom business logic, running code at a specified time or schedule, and improved online/offline caching capability.Most recently, we’ve received numerous requests to add a few security-focused enhancements to the Kinvey platform, on top of our capability to enable online/offline data caching on an end-user’s device. Specifically, companies in the pharmaceutical and financial services industries have asked us to make it easy for them to secure enterprise data on an end-user’s mobile or tablet device (in a BYOD world).These companies have told us that they would prefer to enable client-side data encryption through Kinvey’s client libraries, rather than layering on an MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution.</p>
