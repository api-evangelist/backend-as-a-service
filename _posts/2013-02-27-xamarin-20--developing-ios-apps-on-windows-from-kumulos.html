<p>It’s no secret that whilst Android may have the most freedom when it comes to developing, iOS still has a prominent edge when it comes to the actual earnings of the app developers who work on the platform.This of course makes iOS an attractive platform to work on for developers who are more business minded and are interested in turning a profit on their apps because iOS is more likely to provide a cash flow than Android, and a larger one as well.It’s not all plain sailing when it comes to developing for iOS though.For one, iOS apps are coded in Objective C and if you’re used to something a little more modern or flexible, then you’re going to have a bad time.Another problem is, of course, if you’re a new app developer who doesn’t own a Mac of some description, you’re going to have to buy one, and that hardware doesn’t come particularly cheap.</p>
