<p>We’ve received a lot of feature requests to support other login providers such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and Google+.Once we added the Become API as discussed in my previous post, Bring Your Own Login, this became possible to achieve with Cloud Code for web apps hosted on Parse.Today we’re adding a new tutorial and example code for a simple web app that offers “Login With GitHub”.A live demo of this app can be found here.Check out the tutorial and browse the source code for more information.</p>
