<p>Our goal at Parse is to help you build incredible apps without running your own servers.Often, even if youâ€™re building a mobile app using Parse, you need to create a website as well.We ran into this exact problem while developing our open source AnyPic app.When we had to maintain web servers just to host a few files for a website, we knew we could make things even simpler.Starting today, developers can host static content like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on parseapp.</p>
