<p>Today I’m proud to announce that StackMob has been acquired by PayPal, Inc.and that we will be joining the team at PayPal.It has been an exciting four years at StackMob.We’ve seen the Backend-As-A-Service industry grow from one company to over 40 companies and we have seen mobile technology change the way many companies build applications.Our goal at StackMob has always been to enable developers to build, deploy, and grow their mobile applications, and we’ve learned a lot from you – our customers.</p>
