I try to keep API Evangelist a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for.To meet this demand I&rsquo;m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone.To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the trends section, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page.There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now:

Aggregation - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging
BaaS - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently.&nbsp;Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources
Reciprocity - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs.Realtime - A realtime flow of data and resources using APIs and web technologies, meeting the demand of the API economy.I feel these areas will represent a shift in how APIs are deployed and consumed to meet the growing demand for the data and resources driving web and mobile applications.While the API should exist on its own, these areas represent an evolution in how APIs are bundled together into more meaningful stacks, new mashups of resources and providing the integration, interoperability, automation and real-time needs of  businesses in the API economy.In addition to these four trends, I&rsquo;m looking at several other ways APIs are being used in new and potentially powerful ways:

Voice - With the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, voice is the next generation of discovering and interacting with valuable API resources
Data Analysis - The era of big data is upon us, like it or not.&nbsp;APIs will provide the fuel for the analysis that occurs around the insane amounts of data coming online, but also being generated by new applications and devices
Data Visualization - One fundamental aspect of the big data evolution is being able to visualize and communicate meaning derived from data, and keeping visualizations transparent and interactive using APIs is essential
Syndication - We saw the power of skyndicattion using APIs with the Facebook Like and the Tweet button.</p>
