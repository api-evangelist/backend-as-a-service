<p>A couple of months ago we introduced you to 57Digital Ltd.and their #parsepowered Minecraft apps, Minecraft Explorer Pro, Minecraft Papercraft Studio, and Minecraft Skin Studio.Today, we’re excited to share the news that the team’s latest app, Minecraft Skin Scanner, is being launched and showcased tonight, August 30th, 2013, at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England during the “World of Minecraft” late night event.Minecraft has become more than a game, as evidenced by the respected museum’s attention to it.It’s a cultural phenomenon, where the community of players stretch the limits beyond anything imagined by the creator.</p>
