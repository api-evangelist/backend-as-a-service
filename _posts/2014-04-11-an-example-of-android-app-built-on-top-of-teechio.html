<p>Today we’re pleased to announce our first example of Android application built on top of Teech.io platform.The application is a very simple quiz game with quizzes about 3 different topics.For the project we used our Java/Android SDK that will be soon available together with some tutorials on how to use it in your own applications.In the  meanwhile, just head to the Play Store, download the app and have a look around.</p>
