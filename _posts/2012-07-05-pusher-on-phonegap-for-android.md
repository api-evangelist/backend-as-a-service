{% include JB/setup %}<p>Weve a whole host of client and server libraries for various technologies.This means no matter your technology of choice theres an option for you when using Pusher in your app.Whilst having a library and quality documentation are key aspects when using a service sometimes its also nice to have a getting started project that you can just download and run.Using Pusher on Android with PhoneGap wasnt quite as easy as wed like it to be so I decided to create the Pusher PhoneGap Android starter project.The README covers all the details youll need to get started, but Ive also created a screencast.Im excited about this project because it works around the WebView in Android not supporting WebSockets by using a PhoneGap WebSocket wrapper thats then made accessible to the JavaScript runtime in the WebView.Weve already got a few customers trying out the project but if you have any feedback please drop an email to support@pusher.com or give @pusher a tweet.</p>
