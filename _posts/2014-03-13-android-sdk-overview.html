<p>We have recently updated the Android SDK, a lot of features have been added and a lot of what was there before is now deprecated.In this overview I will try and highlight the major changes in the SDK, following a short tutorial that will lead you to the creation of a small note-taking app for Android, backend by BaasBox.Dear Diary 
The app we are talking about is called Dear Diary.It lets you add and read simple notes on your Android device.The notes are stored in a collection on the BaasBox backend.</p>
