Using the Stripe Cloud Module, developers can validate the Stripe tokens on the Parse cloud.  The following diagram demonstrates this interaction at work:
 We built a sample app to demonstrate what you can do with the Parse + Stripe integration.  Parse Store is an iOS app that lets you buy Parse-branded hoodies, T-shirts, and mugs.<br />
