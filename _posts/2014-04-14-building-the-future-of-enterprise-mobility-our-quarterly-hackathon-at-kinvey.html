<p>Last week was hackathon at Kinvey, and our engineers teamed up to spend three days creating projects that extend the Kinvey platform in exciting new ways.It’s amazing to see what these talented folks can accomplish in such a short time – I think our Sales Director Aaron put it best:
Hackathons are a fun, productive way to make innovative ideas come to life.To that end, we challenged our team to build on Kinvey in ways that can provide real value for our enterprise customers.We decided to judge this quarter’s projects on three criteria: polish and completeness; “Kinvey-ness,” or how well the project advance’s Kinvey’s mission to enable enterprise mobility; and the presentation to the Kinvey team.Big congratulations to Mike Salinger, who took home the title of hackathon winner this year for his Auth Service, which makes any enterprise authorization service look and feel like an OAuth flow for frontend developers.</p>
