{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive been working on expanding the amount of research and writing I can do via API Evangelist lately.In the last couple weeks I rolled out new projects in three areas: API Toolkits, API Trends, API Priorities.This new approach is helping me focus on the areas I think are most important or exciting to the API space and generate as much, high quality news, analysis and white papers for the API space as I can.The first of my white papers, using my new approach is finished.The new paper is called Overview Of The Backend as a Service (BaaS) Space, and is the aggregation of all my research into the BaaS space.</p>
