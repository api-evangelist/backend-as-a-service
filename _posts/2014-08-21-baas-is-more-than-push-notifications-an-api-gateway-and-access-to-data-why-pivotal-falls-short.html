<p>I’m not surprised that yesterday Pivotal announced a short list of disparate components and made it look like they have a mobile service, a la Backend as a Service.They’re right on the heels of AWS’s launch, which followed Apple’s announcement, and we can trace the trend all the way back to Salesforce.com.There’s no denying that mobile is the next frontier for business innovation, and all the enterprises I talk to are making it one of their top 3 priorities.IaaS and PaaS vendors who are either being commoditized or struggling to find enterprise traction and are now looking to pivot and cash in on the mobile momentum.</p>
