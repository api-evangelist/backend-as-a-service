<p>We at Kinvey are excited to announce the release of our native Java client library.Now existing Enterprise Java applications, developed in popular frameworks like Hibernate, Struts, or Spring, can be easily integrated with Kinvey.In addition, new server-side applications can be developed to address common use cases such as accessing Kinvey data in an admin user interface.A native Java library was a commonly requested component because many of our customers and prospects are Java shops and it is important for them to use the stack they are most familiar with.The native Java client library can also be used as part of your Business Logic code running on Google App Engine.</p>
