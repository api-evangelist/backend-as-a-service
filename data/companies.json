Users will feel more protected because they will know that can install on their platform, at any time, the BaaS software and eventually to leave our service and to manage its own backend services as they deem convenient to do so.\nThe key challenge is to create a strong community of developers around our software.","website":"http:\/\/www.baasbox.com\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BaasBox","github":"","blog":"http:\/\/www.baasbox.com\/category\/blog\/","blogrss":"http:\/\/www.baasbox.com\/feed\/","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/baasbox-logo.png","screenshot":null,"tags":"BaaS,BaaS,Open source"},{"id":"64","name":"Flurry","summary":"Flurry helps companies build, measure, advertise and monetize mobile applications in the new app economy.
